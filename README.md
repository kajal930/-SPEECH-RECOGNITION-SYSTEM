## 🧠 Project Title: **Speech Recognition System**

---

### 🎯 Objective  
To build a basic speech-to-text system using pre-trained models and open-source libraries that can convert short audio clips into readable text with high accuracy.

---

### 🔑 Key Activities

- Record or upload speech audio input (WAV or MP3 format).
- Preprocess the audio data (sampling, noise reduction, etc.).
- Apply a speech recognition model to transcribe audio into text.
- Display or store the transcribed text output.
- Develop a Python script or small application that:
  - Accepts audio input
  - Returns corresponding text output
- *(Optional)* Add UI support using Tkinter or Streamlit for better accessibility.

---

### 🛠️ Technologies / Tools Used

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries / Frameworks**:
  - `speech_recognition` – for converting speech to text
  - `pyaudio` or `wave` – for recording or handling audio files
  - `transformers` or `torchaudio` – (optional) for advanced models like Wav2Vec2
  - `streamlit` – (optional) for GUI development

---

### 🎤 Input
- Audio clip (voice recording, user speech, etc.)

### 🧾 Output
- Recognized and transcribed text from the input speech
